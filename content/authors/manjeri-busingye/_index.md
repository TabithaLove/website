Hi! I’m Manjeri Busingye. I am a minister, accountant, business woman, daughter, sister and friend. There’s just never one side about a person and that’s what makes every individual unique and special. I love to help wherever I can and whenever I can. Laughing with friends, singing, traveling, cooking, watching movies, writing and reading are some of the things I love to do. I believe that everyone needs someone to show them some kindness and love. It’s one step closer to making the world a better place.
